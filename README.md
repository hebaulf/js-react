# Javascript/React - Memory Game

For this project I decided to create a memory game using react hooks(state/effect).\
Since I have been watching the Witcher series during the holidays I decided to make that my theme for this.\

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\

### If you want to play with the code

You can clone the repo:

#### `git clone https://github.com/hebaulf/js-react.git`

\

Then install all dependencies:

#### `npm install`

\

And at last run the app:

#### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
