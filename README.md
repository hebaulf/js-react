# Javascript/React - Memory Game

For this project I decided to create a memory game using react hooks(state/effect).

Since I have been watching the Witcher series during the holidays I decided to make that my theme for this.
- I created the cards in Figma using a background image with texture and then .png images (without background) I found of characters and the medallion.
- I decided not to create an elaborate design for the finished project though, because of time, rather focus on the code.
